function [synchpts,synchtype]=findsynch(synch,m,type)

% findsynch() interprets processed synchronization pulse time traces from
% stimulus protocols. 
% 
% To use finsynch() the syntax is:
% 
% [synchpts synchtype]=findsynch(synch)
% 
% The input synch should have either one or two rows. The first row is the
% time trace of the standard deviation of the synch pulse data for each 
% frame (which tells you whether or not a pulse happened in that frame).
% The second row of synch (optional) tells you what type of synch pulse
% happened.
% 
% Other inputs:
%   m       Value for threshold. Defeault is 25% max of synch(1,:)
%   type    Determines if mean is subtracted from synch before
%               thresholding. Default = 1 (subtract mean)
%
%
% findsynch() detects peaks in the first row of synch. The locations of
% these peaks are returned in syncpts. The value of the second row of synch
% at these points is returned as synchtype.
% 
% Note, with the new steps file formats of the stimulus code, findsynch()
% should soon become obsolete. So, be wary of developing new programs that
% use it.
