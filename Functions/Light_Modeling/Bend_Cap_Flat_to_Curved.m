function tpos3=Bend_Cap_Flat_to_Curved(tpos,hrad,type,aX)
%
% This function bends a 2D cap (tpos) around a given single radius 
% of curvature (hrad), assuming either spherical symmetry (type=='hem') or
% cylindrical symmetry (type=='cyl'). If 'cyl', must also include
% the preferred axis (aX) for the cylinder ('x',or,'y')
% The origin is placed at the center of mass of the tpos points.
