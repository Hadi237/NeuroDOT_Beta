function nirfast_mesh=NirfastMesh(mask,meshname,param,Mode)
%
% Mask is the segmented image.
% Mode allows for faster mesh generation for models that will not be used
% for light modeling.
% Key params from cGal help for surface facets and mesh cells:
% from http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Mesh_3/index.html#Chapter_3D_Mesh_Generation
%   facet_angle: This parameter controls the shape of surface facets. 
%                   Actually, it is a lower bound for the angle 
%                   (in degree) of surface facets. When boundary 
%                   surfaces are smooth, the termination of the 
%                   meshing process is guaranteed if the angular 
%                   bound is at most 30 degrees.
%                   Recommend: 25 to 30, not more.
%   facet_size:  This parameter controls the size of surface facets. 
%                   Actually, each surface facet has a surface Delaunay 
%                   ball which is a ball circumscribing the surface 
%                   facet and centered on the surface patch. The 
%                   parameter facet_size is either a constant or a 
%                   spatially variable scalar field, providing an 
%                   upper bound for the radii of surface Delaunay balls.
%                   Recommended ~ 0.15. SMALLER = MORE DENSE
%   facet_distance:    This parameter controls the approximation error of 
%                   boundary and subdivision surfaces. Actually, it 
%                   is either a constant or a spatially variable scalar 
%                   field. It provides an upper bound for the distance 
%                   between the circumcenter of a surface facet and the 
%                   center of a surface Delaunay ball of this facet.
%                   Recommended ~ 0.05. Smaller values will more precisely
%                   match the input surfaces.
%   facet_topology:    This parameters controls the set of topological 
%                   constraints which have to be verified by each 
%                   surface facet. By default, each vertex of a surface 
%                   facet has to be located on a surface patch, on a 
%                   curve segment, or on a corner. It can also be set 
%                   to check whether the three vertices of a surface 
%                   facet belongs to the same surface patch. This has 
%                   to be done cautiously, as such a criteria needs 
%                   that each surface patches intersection is an input 
%                   1-dimensional feature.
%   cell_radius_edge_ratio:  This parameter controls the shape of mesh 
%                   cells (but can't filter slivers, as we discussed 
%                   earlier). Actually, it is an upper bound for the 
%                   ratio between the circumradius of a mesh 
%                   tetrahedron and its shortest edge. There is a 
%                   theoretical bound for this parameter: the Delaunay 
%                   refinement process is guaranteed to terminate for 
%                   values of cell_radius_edge_ratio bigger than 2.
%                   The mesh quality referred to here is measured by 
%                   the radius edge ratio of surface facets end mesh 
%                   cells, where the radius edge ratio of a simplex 
%                   (triangle or tetrahedron) is the the ratio between 
%                   its circumradius and its shortest edge.
%                   Recommended >2, and at or under 4
%   cell_size:   This parameter controls the size of mesh tetrahedra. 
%                   It is either a scalar or a spatially variable scalar 
%                   field. It provides an upper bound on the circumradii 
%                   of the mesh tetrahedra.
%                   Recomended ~ 0.2. SMALLER = MORE DENSE
