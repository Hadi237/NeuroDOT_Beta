function [xdir, ydir, zdir] = CheckOrientation(info)

% CHECKORIENTATION Interpretes 3D orientation information.
%
%   [xdir, ydir, zdir] = CHECKORIENTATION(info) checks the directions of
%   the data encoding in "info.optodes.plot3orientation" to make it
%   compatible with 3D cap visualizations. The default reverses the x-axis
%   and leaves the other two alone. The directions are returned in "xdir",
%   "ydir", and "zdir"
