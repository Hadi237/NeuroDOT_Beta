function [ftmag, ftdomain, ftpower, ftphase] = fft_tts(data, framerate)

% FFT_TTS Performs an FFT.
%
%   ftmag = FFT_TTS(data, framerate) takes a data array "data" of
%   the MEAS x TIME format, pads it timewise to the next highest power of
%   two (for better performance), performs the fast Fourier transform of
%   each channel using the built-in MATLAB function FFT, normalizes by the
%   padded time length, and takes the first half of the transformed data
%   (which is the positive half of the frequency domain). The result is
%   output into "ftmag".
%
%   [ftmag, ftdomain] = FFT_TTS(data, framerate) also returns the
%   corresponding normalized frequency domain "ftdomain", which extends
%   from 0 to the Nyquist frequency, which is calculated from the input
%   "framerate".
%
%   [ftmag, ftdomain, ftpower] = FFT_TTS(data, framerate) also returns the
%   power spectrum, which is the absolute value of the magnitude, squared.
%
%   [ftmag, ftdomain, ftpower, ftphase] = FFT_TTS(data, framerate) also
%   returns the phase at each frequency, as calculated by the MATLAB
%   ANGLE function.
