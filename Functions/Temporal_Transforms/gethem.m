function hem = gethem(data, info, sel_type, value)

% GETHEM Calculates mean across set of measurements.
%
%   hem = GETHEM(data, info) takes a light-level array "data" of the format
%   MEAS x TIME, and using the scan metadata in "info.pairs" averages the
%   measurements for each wavelength present. The result is
%   referred to as the "hem" of a measurement set. If there is a
%   good measurements logical vector present in "info.MEAS.GI", it will be
%   applied to the data; otherwise, "info.MEAS.GI" will be set to true for
%   all measurements (i.e., all measurements are assumed to be good). The
%   variable "hem" is output in the format WL x TIME.
% 
%   hem = GETHEM(data, info, sel_type, value) allows the user to set the
%   criteria for determining shallow measurements. "sel_type" can be 'r2d',
%   'r3d', or 'NN', corresponding to the columns of the "info.pairs" table,
%   and "value" can either take the form of a two-element "[min, max]"
%   vector (for 'r2d' and 'r3d'), or a scalar or vector containing all
%   nearest neighbor numbers to be averaged. By default, this function
%   averages the first nearest neighbor.
