function [data_out,Phi_0] = logmean(data_in)

% LOGMEAN Takes the log-ratio of raw intensity data.
%
%   data_out = LOGMEAN(data_in) takes a light-level data array "data_in" of
%   the format MEAS x TIME, and takes the negative log of each element of a
%   row divided by that row's average. The result is output into "data_out"
%   in the same MEAS x TIME format.
%
%   The formal equation for the LOGMEAN operation is:
%        Y_{out} = -log(phi_{in} / <phi_{in}>)
%
%   If the raw optical data phi is complex (as in the frequency domain 
%   case), Y behaves a bit differently. Phi can be defined in terms of Real
%   and Imaginary parts: Phi = Re(Phi) + 1i.*Im(Phi), or in terms of it's
%   magnitude (A) and phase (theta): Phi = A.*exp(1i.*theta).
%   The temporal average of Phi (what we use for baseline) is best
%   calculated on the Real/Imaginary decription: 
%
%       Phi_o=<phi>=mean(data_in,2) = A_o*exp(i*(th_o));
%
%   Taking the logarithm of complex ratio:
%
%       Y_Rytov=-log(phi/<phi>)=-log[A*exp(i*th)/A_o*exp(i*th_o)]
%                              =-[log(A/A_o) + i(th-th_o)];
%
%       Y_Rytov_Re=-log(abs(data_in/Phi_o));
%       Y_Rytov_Im=-angle(data_in/Phi_o);
%
%   Though this looks like 1 complex number, these components of Y should
%   not mix, so the imaginary component will be tacked onto the end of the
%   measurement list to keep them separate.
%
%
%   Example: If data = [1, 10, 100; exp(1), 10*exp(1), 100*exp(1)];
%
%   then LOGMEAN(data) yields [3.6109, 1.3083, -.9943; 3.6109, 1.3083,
%   -.9943].
