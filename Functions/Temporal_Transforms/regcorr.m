function [data_out, R] = regcorr(data_in, info, hem)

% REGCORR Performs regression correction by wavelengths.
%
%   [data_out, R] = REGCORR(data_in, info, hem) takes a light-level data
%   array "data_in" of the format MEAS x TIME, and using the scan metadata
%   in "info.pairs" and a WL x MEAS "hem" array generated by GETHEM,
%   performs a regression correction for each wavelength of the data, which
%   is returned in the MEAS x TIME array "data_out". The corresponding
%   correlation coefficients for each measurement are returned in "R" as a
%   MEAS x 1 array.
%
%   If y_{r} is the signal to be regressed out and y_{in} is a data
%   time trace (either source-detector or imaged), then the output
%   is the least-squares regression: 
%   y_{out} = y_{in} - y_{r}(<y_{in},y_{r}>/|y_{r}|^2). 
%   Additionally, the correlation coefficient is given by: 
%   R=(<y_{in},y_{r}>/(|y_{in}|*|y_{r}|)).
